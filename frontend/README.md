# Frontend

This folder contains all user interface components of the internal RAG document assistant.  
It currently supports a **Streamlit-based UI** and is structured to allow migration to a **React + API** setup if needed.

---

## Purpose

The `frontend/` directory holds all code that interacts directly with the user, including:
- File upload UI
- Question input interface
- Display of model responses
- (Optionally) future web-based React UI

---

## Structure

| File/Folder        | Purpose |
|--------------------|---------|
| `streamlit_app.py` | Current Streamlit application (used in MVP) |
| `react/`           | Placeholder for future React frontend, if migrating from Streamlit |
| `README.md`        | This documentation file |

---

## Usage

### Run the Streamlit App

From the project root (while in the correct Conda environment):

bash
streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py
Make sure:

    The backend modules (retriever, pipeline, vector_store) are available

    Uploaded PDFs go into the /data/ directory

### Future Migration Path

If you switch from Streamlit to a React-based frontend, the layout already supports:
frontend/
â”œâ”€â”€ react/               # Frontend components (React, Vite, Next.js, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ streamlit_app.py     # Legacy UI (optional)
'

##  UI Swap Strategy
UI Framework	Use Case	Status
Streamlit	MVP, internal testing, demos	âœ… Active
React	Scalable production frontend	ðŸš§ Planned

## Testing

You can create test files in tests/frontend/ for:

    Component rendering (React)

    File upload flow

    Response display
